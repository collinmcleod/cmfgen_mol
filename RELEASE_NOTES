                   RELEASE NOTES

Please run a few test models and report any difficulties.

Please report any compile difficulties. I cannot fix bugs/features
if I don't know about them.

If using PGF95 on the MAC_PRO please contact me. There are a couple
of tricks you need to know about to get the code to run successfully.
Hopefully the features/bugs will be fixed in the next version of the
compiler.

                    30-Jun-2008

(1) Bug fix to $cmfdist/new_main/subs/adjust_pops.f
     (could cause a crash on some machines).

(2) Fixed a stack of write statements: replaced ,X, by ,1X, etc.
    A simple X cause troubles on some compilers.
    Also fixed a few other compiler sensitive statements.

(3) Altered CMFGEN so that a new species can be added almost automatically.
    Proceed as in documentation, but code will now automatically switch from
    USE_FIXED_J=T to USE_FIXED_J=F. Before doing the switch, the code will 
    NOW automatically do a gray temperature correction unless the hidden variable,
    DO_GT_AUTO, is set to false in IN_ITS. Make sure GREY_SCL_FAC_IN is valid.

(4) Some other cleaning. You can always use diff to find out what changes have 
      been made to the code.

(5) If you alter any module files, and have trouble running the code,
      do a clean, and recompile the code. Its possible I may have missed
      the dependencies of some routines on some modules.

                    27-May-2008

(1) As always there are minor bug fixes, changes etc. None should
    significantly affect modeling.

(2) Further improvements to Gauss-fitting option in PLT_SPEC. Designed to measure
    EWs in normalized multiple model spectra in a semi-automatic and automatic fashion.

(3) Options installed to allow hydrostatic structure to be updated automatically
    in CMFGEN. Seems to work fine provided not to close to L(edd).
 
(4) Users wishing to use the relativistic and time-dependent SN routines should
    contact me and/or Luc Dessart. These are still under development and testing. 

                     4-Feb-2008

(1) As always there are minor bug fixes, changes etc. None should
    significantly affect modeling.

(2) Improvements to plane-parallel routines.

(3) DO_AUTO_LAMBDA placed in IN_ITS. Does not have to be present --
default is TRUE. Allows CMFGEN to automatically switch from LAMBDA
iterations, FIXED_J_.TRUE. etc automatically after sufficient
convergence has been obtained. Starting a model with DO_LAMBDA=T
(and DO_AUTO_LAMBDA=T) is now a preferred option.

(4) Improved convergence when there are extremely large corrections
using LAMBDA iterations (e.g., when including X-rays).

(5) Significant changes to allow SN models to be computed including:
      (a) Time variations of statistical equilibrium equations, 
      (b) Inclusion of relativistic terms in transfer equation (moment
             equations only)
      (c) Time dependent radiative transfer.
    These procedures are still under development and refinement, and
    still need rigorous testing (especially the last 2).

(6) Improvements to WIND_HYD to facilitate construction of RVSIG_COL
files assuming a hydrostatic structure. Next version will have the
hydrostructure option included in CMFGEN.

(7) Improved Gauss-fitting option in PLT_SPEC. Designed to measure
    EWs in normalized multiple model spectra in a semi-automatic
    fashion.

(8) Help files for DISPGEN, PLT_SPEC, WR_F_TO_S etc are now now
    accessible by a web page in $cmfdist/web.

Please report any problems or errors.
