22,16   		!Output formatting parameters.

General listing of options in PLT_SPEC Options are ordered under subject.
Associated with each option are requested inputs. Some inputs are not
prompted for, and can only be changed from their default values by specifying
them in the call. eg.

		       RD_MOD(OVER=T)

Such inputs are placed in [ ].

SVE and BOX file:
	Default is to write file MAIN_OPT_STR.sve
	Append sve=filename to write a new .sve file (no brackets)
	Type box=filename to write a .box file containing several .sve files
	Type .filename to read .sve file
	Type #filename to read .box file

        NB: RD_OBS and RD_OBS1 (etc) are presnetly treated as the same option,
            but write different sve files with different names.

Input/output:

    RD_MOD  	Read in new data into MODEL B. Any previous model B data is lost.
                Data may be fluxes, or RJ.

    MOD_A	Switch to model A as the default. B data is not destroyed.

    MOD_B	Switch to model B as the default. A data is not destroyed.
                     
X Axis Options
    LX		Switch between logarithmic and linear X-AXIS
    LOGX        (i.e. do opposite to current setting)
    LINX

    XU		Change units for X-axis. Options are:
    XUNITS	   Hz
		   um
		   Ang
		   keV
	           eV
		   km/s

Y Axis Options
    LY		Switch between logarithmic and linear Y-AXIS
    LOGY        (i.e. do opposite to current setting)
    LINY

    YU		   Change Y plot parameter. Options are:
    Y_UNITS 	      Flam    (ergs/cm^2/s/Ang)
		      FNU     (Jy)
		      NU_FNU  (ergs/cm^2/s)

Main options.
    JD		Plot J or H at a given depth as a function of Lambda
    CF		Plots the integrated flux (H) as a function of depth.

Miscellaneous options.
